# Project — staff kit spine

**Purpose:** One file to drop into (or copy from) a new VS Code project so Grok Build and humans share the same expectations. Framework for robust application development — not product domain content.

**How to use with an agent**

1. Paste or open this file.
2. Answer **§ Intake** (or use multi-choice prompts if the agent offers them).
3. Ask: *“Implement the staff kit for this repo based on my intake answers and the stubs under docs/.”*
4. Agent fills templates, skips declined sections, writes a short Change_Log row for the bootstrap.

## Target file set (after intake)

```text
AGENTS.md
docs/PROCESS.md
docs/Coding_Standards.md
docs/Change_Log.md
docs/Glossary.md
docs/ToDo.md
docs/Lessons_Learned.md
docs/Taste.md                    # optional
docs/skills/General/…            # optional playbooks
docs/skills/Domain/…             # optional
tests/{unit,integration,smoke}/
```

App-specific docs (schema, runbooks, product ADRs) stay **outside** this kit once the app grows.

---

## Skeleton rules (agent implements)

1. **Never load the whole docs set** into context — open only files named by AGENTS / task.
2. **One Change_Log entry per user-visible change** (Why / What / Benefit). If a view/tab paint changed, add **Shot:** (PROCESS § Screenshots).
3. **ToDo** updated when backlog items complete or cancel.
4. **Module size:** prefer files under ~500 lines; split by purpose (not arbitrary chops).
5. **Tests:** new behavior → unit first; cross-layer → integration; UI shell → smoke.
6. **Secrets:** never commit `.env`, tokens, dumps.
7. **Generic vs specific:** kit files stay portable; product truth lives in the app repo.

---

## Lightweight practices (solo / small team)

Enough structure to stay reliable — not a process theater.

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Main stays shippable** | Land work on short-lived branches (or sequential commits on solo work); avoid long-lived “mystery” branches. |
| **Definition of done** | Behavior works · relevant test · Change_Log/ToDo if user-visible · secrets still out of git. |
| **Read your own diff** | Before commit: `git status` + diff; agents still need a human sanity check. |
| **Lock dependencies** | Commit `requirements.txt` or lockfile; recreate envs from the file, not “whatever was on the machine.” |
| **One config story** | `.env` / env vars for secrets and local paths; document required keys in `.env.example` (no values that matter). |
| **Backup before destructive DB** | `pg_dump` (or equivalent) before migrations that drop or rewrite data. |
| **Keep AGENTS architecture current** | One paragraph that matches the real stack beats a stale essay. |
| **Multi-agent only when it pays** | Tiny fixes stay on main agent; spawn specialists for large exclusive trees (schema vs UI vs tests). |
| **Handoff note** | Short: what changed · how to verify · push status (local until asked). |

Skip formal sprint ceremony, mandatory PR templates, and multi-page ADRs until the team or risk actually needs them.

## Public sharing / demos (careful)

| Usually OK | Avoid |
|------------|--------|
| Staff kit (this repo) | Secrets, tokens, `.env` |
| Generic UI / architecture demos | Live production data, PII, credentials |
| Architecture diagrams | Account numbers, emails, API keys in cleartext |
| Redacted process docs | Full personal Change_Log dumps with private detail |

Crop screenshots that show private identifiers. Prefer sample or synthetic data when presenting.

---

## Meetup talk track (optional agenda)

Use this kit as the demo spine (not a specific product’s internals).

1. Grok Build in VS Code + GitHub  
2. Skill / staff files: AGENTS, PROCESS, Coding_Standards  
3. Documentation: Change_Log, Glossary  
4. Logging  
5. Testing (unit / smoke / integration, pytest, screenshots)  
6. Database (schema, migrations, backups) — if included  
7. Data model (session-style ownership over map sprawl) — if applicable  
8. UI patterns (tabs, status, refresh, log) — if applicable  
9. Performance (caching, honest limits of UI stacks)  
10. Self-assessment prompts (prompts on *prompts* and on *Change_Log*)  
11. Parallel work (agents + language threads — different tools)  
12. Cost / ROI (fill your own numbers)

---

## Self-assessment prompts (exercises)

**#1 — Prompts:**  
*Looking at my prompts, what can you tell me about the type of programmer I am, my style, experience level, and areas for improvement?*

**#2 — Change_Log:**  
*Looking at Change_Log.md, what can you tell me about the type of programmer I am, my style, experience level, and areas for improvement?*

## OOP analogy: kit vs app docs

| Layer | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Base (this kit)** | Portable process | “Always keep a Change_Log” |
| **Subclass (app)** | Product instance | App’s long Change_Log, deploy runbook, domain skills |
| **Do not** | Merge product secrets into the kit | Tokens, customer data, vendor quirks |

When the app learns a **general** lesson, promote a short rule into this kit. When the lesson is **domain-only**, keep it in the app (or `docs/skills/Domain/`).

---

## Agent bootstrap prompt (copy-paste)

```text
Open Project.md and the stubs under docs/.
I answered intake as follows:
  <paste answers>

Implement the staff kit for this repository:
- Keep files portable (no personal secrets, no product-domain content).
- Skip modules I set to N.
- Fill placeholders; leave TODO comments where I must supply product names.
- Add one Change_Log entry for this bootstrap.
Do not push unless I ask.
```
